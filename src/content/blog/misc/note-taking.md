We have begun writing notes since elementary school, continuously taking courses and learning new knowledge daily. However, this does not necessarily mean we're experts in taking notes. I have been figuring out the method with the highest efficiency, and here are some of my thoughts.

_Notes aren't simply copy-pasting the textbook._ This is entirely time-wasting, especially in the 21st century, where you can quickly get a response by asking ChatGPT.

_Notes are a combination of summarization and personal thoughts._ (Contents not included in the textbooks or questions that popped out during the learning process.) AI tools generate quick summarization but fail to make logical connections and generate inspiration. We humans can do much better.

The goal of taking notes is to recap the essentials quickly. To achieve this goal, these are two main points:
- *Notes should be intuitive.* We love looking at graphs and PowerPoint presentations instead of reading long, tedious paragraphs.
- *Notes should be intensely logical.* The only way to fully understand a logical derivation is to be able to tell it in its entirety to someone else.
- *Notes (in the form of text) should be brief.* We wish to absorb new information efficiently.
